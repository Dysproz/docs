<p id="topic-content"><h1 id="jd0e3">Customized Hash Field Selection for ECMP Load Balancing</h1><sw-topic-details date="2020-11-11"> </sw-topic-details><h2 id="jd0e10">Overview: Custom Hash Feature</h2><p>Contrail Networking enables you to configure the set of fields
used to hash upon during equal-cost multipath (ECMP) load balancing. </p><p>With the custom hash feature, users can configure an exact subset
of fields to hash upon when choosing the forwarding path among a set
of eligible ECMP candidates. </p><p>The custom hash configuration can be applied in the following
ways:</p><ul><li style=""><p>globally</p></li><li style=""><p>per virtual network (VN)</p></li><li style=""><p>per virtual network interface (VMI)</p></li></ul><p>VMI configurations take precedence over VN configurations, and
VN configurations take precedence over global level configuration
(if present). </p><p>Custom hash is useful whenever packets originating from a particular
source and addressed to a particular destination must go through the
same set of service instances during transit. This might be required
if source, destination, or transit nodes maintain a certain state
based on the flow, and the state behavior could also be used for subsequent
new flowsl, between the same pair of source and destination addresses.
In such cases, subsequent flows must follow the same set of service
nodes followed by the initial flow. </p><p>You can use the Contrail Web UI to identify specific fields
in the network upon which to hash at the <strong v-pre="">Configure &gt; Networking
&gt; Network, Create Network</strong> window, in the <strong v-pre="">ECMP Hashing Fields</strong> section as shown in the following figure. </p><figure id="jd0e41"><div class="graphic"><img alt="" src="images/S018553.png" style=""/></div></figure><p>If the hashing fields are configured for a virtual network,
all traffic destined to that VN will be subject to the customized
hash field selection during forwarding over ECMP paths by vRouters.
This may not be desirable in all cases, as it could potentially skew
all traffic to the destination network over a smaller set of paths
across the IP fabric. </p><p>A more practical scenario is one in which flows between a source
and destination must go through the same service instance in between,
where one could configure customized ECMP fields for the virtual machine
interface of the service instance. Then, each service chain route
originating from that virtual machine interface would get the desired
ECMP field selection applied as its path attribute, and eventually
get propagated to the ingress vRouter node. See the following example.</p><figure id="jd0e47"><div class="graphic"><img alt="" src="images/s018740.png" style=""/></div></figure><h2 id="jd0e49">Using ECMP Hash Fields Selection</h2><p>Custom hash fields selection is most useful in scenarios where
multiple ECMP paths exist for a destination. Typically, the multiple
ECMP paths point to ingress service instance nodes, which could be
running anywhere in the Contrail cloud. </p><h3 id="jd0e54">Configuring ECMP Hash Fields Over Service Chains</h3><p>Use the following steps to create customized hash fields with
ECMP over service chains.</p><ol type="1"><li id="jd0e61" style="">Create the virtual networks needed to interconnect using
service chaining, with ECMP load-balancing.</li><li id="jd0e64" style="">Create a service template and enable scaling.</li><li id="jd0e67" style="">Create a service instance, and using the service template,
configure by selecting:<ul><li style=""><p>the desired number of instances for scale-out</p></li><li style=""><p>the left and right virtual network to connect</p></li><li style=""><p>the shared address space, to make sure that instantiated
services come up with the same IP address for left and right, respectively</p></li></ul><p>This configuration enables ECMP among all those service instances
during forwarding.</p></li><li id="jd0e82" style="">Create a policy, then select the service instance previously
created and apply the policy to to the desired VMIs or VNs.</li><li id="jd0e85" style="">	After the service VMs are instantiated, the ports of
the left and right interfaces are available for further configuration.
At the Contrail Web UI Ports section under Networking, select the
ports on the left interface (virtual machine interface) of the service
instance and apply the desired ECMP hash field configuration.<sw-admonition name="note" style=""><strong class="title">Note</strong><p>Currently the ECMP field selection configuration for the service
instance left or right interface must be applied by using the Ports
(VMIs) section under Networking and explicitly configuring the ECMP
fields selection for each of the instantiated service instances' VMIs.
This must be done for all service interfaces of the group, to ensure
the end result is as expected, because the load balance attribute
of only the best path is carried over to the ingress vRouter. If the
load balance attribute is not configured, it is not propagated to
the ingress vRouter, even if other paths have that configuration.</p></sw-admonition></li></ol><p>When the configuration is finished, the vRouters get programmed
with routing tables with the ECMP paths to the various service instances.
The vRouters are also programmed with the desired ECMP hash fields
to be used during load balancing of the traffic. </p><sw-prev-next> </sw-prev-next></p>
