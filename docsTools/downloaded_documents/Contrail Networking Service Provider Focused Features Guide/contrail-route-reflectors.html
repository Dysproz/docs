in the Control node for Internal Border Gateway Protocol (iBGP) peers.
Route reflection is a BGP feature that enables BGP routers to acquire
route information from one iBGP router and reflect or advertise the
information to other iBGP peers in the same autonomous system (AS). </p><p> In a large scale AS, deploying BGP routers peering with the
Control Node in a full-mesh topology affects scalability and leads
to maintenance and configurational issues. The issues are caused while
exchanging large volumes of routing information and maintaining connectivity
among a large number of devices in the AS. A Route Reflector provides
a scalable alternative to full-mesh internal BGP peering. See <a href="contrail-route-reflectors.html#route-reflector-contrail">Figure 1</a>.</p><figure id="route-reflector-contrail"><figcaption>Figure 1: Advantage of BGP Route

have a unique cluster ID to prevent looping among the RRs. </p><p>Contrail nodes support Edge Reflection Multicasting Virtual
Private Networking (ERMVPN) of the BGP Address Family. As non-Contrail
nodes do not support ERMVPN, RR is configured separately for Contrail
nodes, and external BGP speakers. If a single RR is deployed between
Contrail nodes and non-Contrail nodes, the RR cannot advertise ERMVPN
routes to the Contrail nodes. Contrail deploys a separate RR peering
session among Contrail nodes that supports ERMVPN and helps in propagating
routes among all Contrail nodes.</p><h2 id="jd0e27">Benefits of RRs in Contrail</h2><ul><li style=""><p>RRs can be deployed at multiple locations in the network,
which helps to scale the BGP network at lower cost.</p></li><li style=""><p>The RR feature conserves data center rack space by replacing
physical route reflectors.</p></li></ul><sw-prev-next> </sw-prev-next></p>
