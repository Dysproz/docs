exported to the Contrail collector, flow handling, and flow aging.</p><h2 id="jd0e14">Flow Sampling</h2><p>The Contrail vRouter agent exports flow records to the Contrail
collector when a flow is created or deleted. It also updates flow
statistics at regular intervals.</p><p>If  all flow records are exported from the agent, depending
on the scale of flows, some of the exported flows might be dropped
due to queue overflow.</p><p>Based on sampling, flow records are sampled and exported to
the Contrail Controller of Contrail Networking. This enables Contrail
Networking to reduce queue overflow. </p><p>The flows that are exported are selected based on the following
parameters used in the algorithm:</p><ul><li style=""><p>The configured flow export rate. This is configured as
part of the <code class="inline" v-pre="">global-vrouter-config</code> object.</p></li><li style=""><p>The actual flow export rate.</p></li><li style=""><p>The sampling threshold. This is a dynamic value calculated
internally. If the flow statistics in a flow sample are above this
threshold, the flow record is exported.</p></li></ul><p>Each flow is subjected to the following algorithm at regular
intervals. The algorithm determines whether to export the sample or
not.</p><ul><li style=""><p>Flows with traffic that is greater than or equal to the
sampling threshold are always exported. The byte and packet counts
are reported without modification.</p></li><li style=""><p>Flows with traffic that is less than the sampling threshold
are exported according to the probability. The byte and packet counts
are adjusted upwards according to the probability.</p><p>The probability is calculated as <code class="equation" v-pre="">(bytes during the
interval) / (sampling threshold)</code>.</p></li><li style=""><p>The system generates a random number less than the sampling
threshold. If the byte count during the interval is less than the
random number, then the flow sample is not exported.</p></li><li style=""><p> If none of these conditions are met, the flow sample
is exported after normalizing the byte count and packet count during
the interval. Normalization is done by dividing the byte count and
packet count during the interval by the probability. This normalization
is used as a heuristic to account for statistics of flow samples that
are dropped.</p></li></ul><p>The actual flow export rate is close to the configured export
rate. If there is a large deviation, the sampling threshold is adjusted
to bring the actual flow export rate close to the configured flow
export rate.</p><h2 id="jd0e62">Flow Handling</h2><p>When a virtual machine sends or receives IP traffic, forward
and reverse flow entries are set up. When the first packet arrives,
a flow key is used to hash into a flow table (identify a hash bucket).
The flow key is based on five-tuples consisting of source and destination
IP addresses, ports, and the IP protocol.</p><p>A flow entry is created and the packet is sent to the Contrail
vRouter agent. Configured policies are applied and the flow action
is updated. The agent also creates a flow entry for the reverse direction
where relevant. Subsequent packets match the established flow entries
and are forwarded, dropped, NAT translated, and so on, based on the
flow action.</p><p>When the hash bucket is full, entries are created in an overflow
table. Contrail Networking maintains the overflow entries as a list
against the hash bucket.</p><p>By default, the maximum number of flow table and overflow table
entries are 512,000 and 8000 respectively. These can be modified by
configuring them as vRouter module parameters, for example: <span class="cli" v-pre="">vr_flow_entries</span> and <code class="inline" v-pre="">vr_oflow_entries</code>.</p><p>For more information about the vRouter module parameters, see <a href="https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-controller/wiki/Vrouter-Module-Parameters">https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-controller/wiki/Vrouter-Module-Parameters</a>.</p><h2 id="jd0e84">Flow Aging</h2><p>Flows are aged out based on inactivity for a specified period
of time. By default, the timeout value is 180 seconds. This can be
modified by configuring the <span class="cli" v-pre="">flow_cache_timeout</span> parameter
under the <code class="inline" v-pre="">DEFAULT</code> section in the <span class="cli" v-pre="">/etc/contrail/contrail-vrouter-agent.conf</span> file.</p><h2 id="jd0e98">TCP State-Based Flow Handling and Aging</h2><ul><li style=""><p><a href="flow-sample-overview.html#jd0e106">TCP State-Based Flow Handling</a></p></li><li style=""><p><a href="flow-sample-overview.html#jd0e119">Protocol-Based Flow Aging</a></p></li></ul><h3 id="jd0e106">TCP State-Based Flow Handling</h3><p>The Contrail vRouter in Contrail Networking monitors TCP flows
to identify entries that can be reused without going through the standard
aging cycle.</p><p>All flow entries that match TCP flows that have experienced
a connection teardown, either through the standard TCP closure cycle
(FIN/ACK-FIN/ACK) or the RST indicator, are torn down by the vRouter
and are immediately available for use by new qualified flows. </p><p>The vRouter also keeps track of connection establishment cycles
and exports the necessary information to the vRouter agent, such as
SYN/ACK and a digested established flag. This allows the vRouter agent
to tear down flows that do not experience a full connection cycle.</p><p>Flows that the vRouter identifies as reuse candidates, or eviction
candidates, are marked as such in the flow entry. Flows are in the
evicted state when they become available for other new flows to be
reused. </p><p>This two-step transition is used so that the flow entry remains
valid until the packet reaches the destination, preventing the flow
from getting remapped to another flow entry in the interim.</p><h3 id="jd0e119">Protocol-Based Flow Aging</h3><p>Although TCP flows are deleted based on TCP state, you are sometimes
required to age out specific protocol flows more aggressively. One
example is when a DNS server is run in one VM. In this case, multiple
flows are set up for DNS. A pair of flows are set up to serve each
query. Because the flows are no longer required after the query is
served, the timeout can be lower for these flows. To handle these
cases, protocol-based flow aging is used.  </p><p>With protocol-based flow aging, the aging timeout can be configured
per protocol. All other protocols continue to use the default aging
timeout.</p><p>Protocol-based flow aging is also supported in Contrail Networking.</p><p>The configuration for protocol-based flow aging can be done
in the <code class="inline" v-pre="">global-vrouter-config</code> object. For
example, to have all DNS flows aged out in five seconds, use the following
entry: <code class="inline" v-pre="">protocol = udp, port = 53 will be set an aging
timeout of 5 seconds.</code></p><sw-prev-next> </sw-prev-next></p>
