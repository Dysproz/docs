<p id="topic-content"><h1 id="jd0e2">Optimizing DPDK vRouter Performance Through Full CPU Partitioning
and Isolation</h1><sw-topic-details date="2020-03-19"> </sw-topic-details><p>Contrail Networking Release 2003 supports full CPU partitioning.
CPU isolation is an RHEL method to partition and isolate the CPU cores
on a compute node from the symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) balancing
and scheduler algorithms. The full CPU isolation feature optimizes
the performance of DPDK vRouter when deployed with the DPDK settings
recommended for RHOSP.</p><p>CPU isolation helps isolate forwarding cores, VNF cores, and
service cores so that VNF threads and service threads do not send
processing requests to forwarding cores. By applying CPU isolation,
you can allocate dedicated forwarding cores to the DPDK VM and ensure
that other processes do not send processing requests to the cores
allocated to DPDK vRouter, which in turn improves the performance
of vRouter to a large extent. </p><p>For CPU isolation and partitioning, RedHat recommends two methods.
The first method is by using a utility called <span class="cli" v-pre="">tuned</span>, which
partitions the CPU to virtual network functions (VNFs) and isolates
these cores from the host OS. The <span class="cli" v-pre="">tuned</span> method removes
isolated CPUs from the common CPU list that is used to process all
tasks and perform CPU isolation after the system boot, by using the <span class="cli" v-pre="">systemd</span> process.</p><p>The second is <span class="cli" v-pre="">isolcpus</span>, a kernel parameter that keeps
CPUs away from the Linux scheduler. Similar to <span class="cli" v-pre="">tuned</span>, the <span class="cli" v-pre="">isolcpus</span> method also removes isolated CPUs from the common
CPU list that is used to process all tasks, and performs CPU isolation
at system startup. To enable <span class="cli" v-pre="">isolcpus</span>, you need to modify
the GRUB configuration in <code class="filepath">/etc/default/grub</code> so that a new set of isolated CPU is considered. The node needs
to be restarted for the changes to take effect.</p><p>To enable CPU isolation using <span class="cli" v-pre="">tuned</span>, configure the <span class="cli" v-pre="">ContrailDpdkParameters</span> in <code class="filepath">/tripleo-heat-templates/environments/contrail/contrail-services.yaml</code> for RHOSP and <span class="cli" v-pre="">SERVICE_CORE_MASK </span>and <span class="cli" v-pre="">DPDK_CTRL_THREAD_MASK</span> parameters in <code class="filepath">/vrouter/agent-dpdk/entrypoint.sh</code> file for Contrail Ansible Deployer.</p><div class="sample" dir="ltr" id="jd0e61"><p><b>In contrail-services.yaml</b></p><div class="output" dir="ltr"><sw-code><template v-pre=""><pre># Tuned-d profile configuration
