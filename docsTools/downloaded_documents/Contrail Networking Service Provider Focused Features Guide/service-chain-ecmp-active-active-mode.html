across VMs. </p><h2 id="jd0e13">Service Chain with Equal-Cost Multipath in Active-Active Mode</h2><p>To support ECMP in the service chain, create multiple port tuples
within the same service instance. The labels should be the same for
the VM ports in each port tuple. For example, if port tuple 1 uses
the labels <code class="inline" v-pre="">left</code> and <code class="inline" v-pre="">right</code>, then port tuple 2 in the same service instance should also use
the labels <code class="inline" v-pre="">left</code> and <code class="inline" v-pre="">right</code> for its ports. </p><p>When there are multiple port tuples, the default mode of operation
is <code class="inline" v-pre="">active-active</code>. </p><h2 id="jd0e35">Service Chain with Health Check</h2><p>Service chain Version 2 also allows service instance health
check configuration on a per interface label. This is used to monitor
the health of the service. </p><p>For more information about the service instance health check,
