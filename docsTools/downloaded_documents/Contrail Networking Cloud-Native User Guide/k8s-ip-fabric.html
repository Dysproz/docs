supported features in Contrail.</p></div></div><h2 id="jd0e16">TLS Bootstrapping of Kubernetes Nodes</h2><p>Contrail supports TLS Bootstrapping of Kubernetes Nodes starting
in Contrail Networking Release 5.1. TLS bootstrapping streamlines
Kubernetes’ ability to add and remove nodes from the Contrail
cluster.</p><h2 id="jd0e21">Priority Based Multitenancy</h2><p>Contrail supports priority on the various resource quotas through
the ResourceQuotaScopeSelector feature starting in Contrail Networking
Release 5.1.</p><h2 id="jd0e26">Improved Autoscaling</h2><p>Contrail Networking supports improved pod autoscaling by creating
and deleting pods based on the load starting in Contrail Networking
Release 5.1.</p><h2 id="jd0e31">Reachability to Kubernetes Pods Using the IP Fabric Forwarding
Feature</h2><p>A Kubernetes pod is a group of one or more containers (such
as Docker containers), the shared storage for those containers, and
options on how to run the containers. Since pods are in the overlay
network, they cannot be reached directly from the underlay without
a gateway or vRouter. Starting in Contrail Networking Release 5.0,
the IP fabric forwarding (<span class="cli" v-pre="">ip-fabric-forwarding</span>) feature
enables virtual networks to be created as part of the underlay network
and eliminates the need for encapsulation and decapsulation of data.
The ip-fabric-forwarding feature is only applicable for pod networks.
If <span class="cli" v-pre="">ip-fabric-forwarding</span> is enabled, pod-networks are associated
to ip-fabric-ipam instead of pod-ipam which is also a flat subnet.</p><p>The ip-fabric-forwarding feature is enabled and disabled in
the global and namespace levels. By default, <span class="cli" v-pre="">ip-fabric-forwarding</span> is disabled in the global level. To enable it in global level, you
must set <span class="cli" v-pre="">“ip_fabric_forwarding”</span> to <span class="cli" v-pre="">“true”</span> in the <span class="cli" v-pre="">“[KUBERNETES]”</span> section of the <code class="filepath">/etc/contrail/contrail-kubernetes.conf</code> file. To
enable or disable the feature in namespace level, you must set <span class="cli" v-pre="">“ip_fabric_forwarding”</span> to <span class="cli" v-pre="">“true”</span> or <span class="cli" v-pre="">“false”</span> respectively in namespace annotation.
For example, <span class="cli" v-pre="">“opencontrail.org/ip_fabric_forwarding”:
“true”</span>. Once the feature is enabled, it cannot be
disabled.</p><p>For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/tungstenfabric/tf-specs/blob/master/gateway-less-forwarding.md">Gateway-less Forwarding</a>.</p><h2 id="jd0e76">Service Isolation Through Virtual Networks</h2><p>In namespace isolation mode, services in one namespace are not
accessible from other namespaces, unless security groups or network
policies are explicitly defined to allow access. If any Kubernetes
service is implemented by pods in an isolated namespace, those services
are reachable only to pods in the same namespace through the Kubernetes <span class="cli" v-pre="">service-ip</span>.  </p><p>The Kubernetes <span class="cli" v-pre="">service-ip</span> is allocated from the cluster
network despite being in an isolated namespace. So, by default, service
from one namespace can reach services from another namespace. However,
security groups in isolated namespaces prevent reachability from external
namespace and also prevent reachability from outside of the cluster.
In order to enable access by external namespaces, the security group
must be edited to allow access to all namespaces which defeats the
purpose of isolation. </p><p>Contrail Networking—starting in Contrail Networking Release
5.0—enables service or ingress reachability from external clusters
in isolated namespaces. Two virtual networks are created in isolated
namespaces. One network is dedicated to pods and one is dedicated
to services. Contrail network-policy is created between the pod network
and the service network for reachability between pods and services.
Service uses the same service-ipam which is a flat-subnet like pod-ipam.
It is applicable for default namespace as well.</p><h2 id="jd0e91">Contrail ip-fabric-snat Feature</h2><p>With the Contrail ip-fabric-snat feature, pods that are in the
overlay can reach the Internet without floating IPs or a logical-router.
The ip-fabric-snat feature uses compute node IP for creating a source
NAT to reach the required services and is applicable only to pod networks.
The kube-manager reserves ports 56000 through 57023 for TCP and 57024
through 58047 for UDP to create a source NAT in global-config during
the initialization.  </p><p>The ip-fabric-snat feature can be enabled or disabled in the
global or namespace levels. By default, the feature is disabled in
the global level. To enable the ip-fabric-snat feature in the global
level, you must set <span class="cli" v-pre="">“ip-fabric-snat”</span> to <span class="cli" v-pre="">“true”</span> in the <span class="cli" v-pre="">“[KUBERNETES]”</span> section in the <code class="filepath">/etc/contrail/contrail-kubernetes.conf</code> file. To enable or disable it in the namespace level, you must set <span class="cli" v-pre="">“ip_fabric_snat”</span> to <span class="cli" v-pre="">“true”</span> or <span class="cli" v-pre="">“false”</span> respectively in namespace annotation.
For example, <span class="cli" v-pre="">“opencontrail.org/ip_fabric_snat”: “true”</span>. The ip_fabric_snat feature can be at enabled and disabled any time.
To enable or disable the ip_fabric_snat feature in the default-pod-network,
default namespace must be used. If the <span class="cli" v-pre="">ip_fabric_forwarding</span> is enabled, <span class="cli" v-pre="">ip_fabric_snat</span> is ignored.</p><p>For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/tungstenfabric/tf-specs/blob/master/distributed-snat.md">Distributed SNAT</a>.</p><h2 id="jd0e133">Third-Party Ingress Controllers</h2><p>Multiple ingress controllers can co-exist in Contrail. If <span class="cli" v-pre="">“kubernetes.io/ingress.class”</span> is absent or is <span class="cli" v-pre="">“opencontrail”</span> in the annotations of the Kubernetes
ingress resource, the kube-manager creates a HAProxy loadbalancer.
Otherwise it is ignored and the respective ingress controller handles
the ingress resource. Since Contrail ensures the reachability between
pods and services, any ingress controller can reach the endpoints
or pods directly or through services.</p><h2 id="jd0e144">Custom Network Support for Ingress Resources</h2><p>Contrail supports custom networks in namespace level for pods.
Starting with Contrail Release 5.0, custom networks are supported
for ingress resources as well.</p><h2 id="jd0e149">Kubernetes Probes and Kubernetes Service Node-Port</h2><p>The Kubelet needs reachability to pods for liveness and readiness
probes. Contrail network policy is created between the IP fabric network
and pod network to provide reachability between node and pods. Whenever
the pod network is created, the network policy is attached to the
pod network to provide reachability between node and pods. So, any
process in the node can reach the pods. </p><p>Kubernetes Service Node-Port is based on node reachability to
pods. Since Contrail provides connectivity between node and pods through
Contrail the network policy, Node Port is supported.</p><h2 id="jd0e156"> Kubernetes Network-Policy Support</h2><p>Contrail Networking supports the following Kubernetes release
1.12 network policy features:</p><ul><li style=""><p>Egress support for network policy—Each <span class="cli" v-pre="">NetworkPolicy</span> includes a <span class="cli" v-pre="">policyTypes</span> list which can include either <span class="cli" v-pre="">Ingress</span>, <span class="cli" v-pre="">Egress</span>, or both. The <span class="cli" v-pre="">policyTypes</span> field indicates whether or not the given policy applies to ingress
traffic to selected pod, egress traffic from the selected pod, or
both. Contrail Networking—starting in Contrail Networking Release
5.1—supports the <span class="cli" v-pre="">podSelector&amp;namespaceSelector</span> egress specification. Contrail Networking—starting in Contrail
Networking Release 5.0—supports  <span class="cli" v-pre="">podSelector</span>, <span class="cli" v-pre="">namespaceSelector</span>, and <span class="cli" v-pre="">egress CIDR</span> egress specifications.</p></li><li style=""><p>Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR) selector support
for egress and ingress network policies</p></li><li style=""><p>Contrail-ansible-deployer provisioning—Contrail-ansible-deployer
is updated to support Kubernetes 1.12.</p></li></ul><p>Contrail Networking supports Kubernetes release 1.9.2 and enables
implementing Kubernetes network policy in Contrail using the Contrail
firewall security policy framework. While Kubernetes network policy
can be implemented using other security objects in Contrail like security
groups and Contrail network policies, the support of tags by Contrail
firewall security policy aids in the simplification and abstraction
of workloads.</p><p>For more information, see <a href="k8s-network-policy.html">Implementation of Kubernetes Network Policy with Contrail Firewall Policy</a>.</p><sw-prev-next> </sw-prev-next></p>
