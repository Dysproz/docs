<p id="topic-content"><h1 id="jd0e2">Understanding Contrail Analytics</h1><sw-topic-details date="2020-08-18"> </sw-topic-details><p>Contrail is a distributed system of compute nodes, control
nodes, configuration nodes, database nodes, web UI nodes, and analytics
nodes. </p><p>The analytics nodes are responsible for the collection of system
state information, usage statistics, and debug information from all
of the software modules across all of the nodes of the system. The
analytics nodes store the data gathered across the system in a database
that is based on the Apache Cassandra open source distributed database
management system. The database is queried by means of an SQL-like
language and representational state transfer (REST) APIs.  </p><p>System state information collected by the analytics nodes is
aggregated across all of the nodes.</p><p>Debug information collected by the analytics nodes includes
the following types:</p><ul><li style=""><p>System log (syslog) messages—informational and debug
messages generated by system software components.</p></li><li style=""><p>Object log messages—records of changes made to system
objects such as virtual machines, virtual networks, service instances,
virtual routers, BGP peers, routing instances, and the like.</p></li><li style=""><p>Trace messages—records of activities collected locally
by software components and sent to analytics nodes only on demand.</p></li></ul><p>Statistics information related to flows, CPU and memory usage,
and the like is also collected by the analytics nodes and can be queried
to provide historical analytics and time-series information. The queries
are performed using REST APIs.</p><p>Analytics data is written to a database in Contrail. The data
expires after the default time-to-live (TTL) period of 48 hours. This
default TTL time can be changed as needed by changing the value of
the <code class="inline" v-pre="">database_ttl </code>value in the cluster configuration.</p><sw-prev-next> </sw-prev-next></p>
