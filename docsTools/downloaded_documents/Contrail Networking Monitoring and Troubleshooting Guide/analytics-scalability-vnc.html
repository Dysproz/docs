<p id="topic-content"><h1 id="jd0e3">Analytics Scalability</h1><sw-topic-details date="2019-02-08"> </sw-topic-details><p>The Contrail monitoring and analytics services (<em>collector</em> role) collect and store data generated by various
system components and provide the data to the Contrail interface by
means of representational state transfer (REST) application program
interface (API) queries.</p><p>The Contrail components are horizontally scalable to ensure
consistent performance as the system grows. Scalability is provided
for the generator components (<em>control</em> and <em>compute</em> roles) and for the REST API users (<em>webui</em> role).</p><p>This section provides a brief description of the recommended
configuration of analytics in Contrail to achieve horizontal scalability.</p><p>The following is the recommended locations for the various component
roles of the Contrail system for a 5-node configuration.</p><ul><li style=""><p>Node 1 —config role, web-ui role</p></li><li style=""><p>Node 2 —control role, analytics role, database role</p></li><li style=""><p>Node 3 —control role, analytics role, database role</p></li><li style=""><p>Node 4 —compute role</p></li><li style=""><p>Node 5 —compute role</p></li></ul><p><a href="analytics-scalability-vnc.html#analytics-scalable">Figure 1</a> illustrates scalable
connections for analytics in a 5-node system, with the nodes configured
for roles as recommended above. The analytics load is distributed
between the two analytics nodes. This configuration can be extended
to any number of analytics nodes. </p><figure id="analytics-scalable"><figcaption>Figure 1: Analytics Scalability</figcaption><div class="graphic"><img alt="Analytics Scalability" src="images/s041520.gif" style=""/></div></figure><p>The analytics nodes collect and store data and provide this
data through various REST API queries. Scalability is provided for
the control nodes, the compute nodes, and the REST API users, with
the API output displayed in the Contrail user interface. As the number
of control and compute nodes increase in the system, the analytics
nodes can also be increased. </p><sw-prev-next> </sw-prev-next></p>
