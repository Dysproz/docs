Mirroring)</h1><sw-topic-details date="2019-02-08"> </sw-topic-details><p>When mirroring is enabled, the vRouter throughput reduces because
of the additional packet handling overhead caused by cloning the packet
to be mirrored, encapsulating it in the required header, and forwarding
it to the mirror destination. Impact to throughput increases in proportion
to the amount of traffic that needs to be mirrored.</p><p>A solution to avoid impact on throughput due to mirroring is
to use the mirroring capabilities of an installed Network Interface
Card (NIC).</p><p>Contrail Release 4.0 has the ability to mirror specific traffic
to a traffic analyzer or to a physical probe using the Network interface
card (NIC) instead of the vRouter to mirror packets. When NIC-assisted
mirroring is enabled, ingress packets to be mirrored sent from a VM
are routed to the NIC with a configured VLAN tag. The NIC is configured
for VLAN port-mirroring and mirrors any packet with the VLAN tag.</p><p>In this approach, the vRouter doesn’t mirror the packets.
When NIC-assisted mirroring is enabled, the ingress packets coming
from the VM that are to be mirrored are sent to the NIC with a configured
VLAN tag. </p><p>The NIC is programmed to do VLAN port mirroring, so that iany
packet with the configured VLAN is mirrored additionally by the NIC.
This change in vRouter is only for traffic coming from the VMs. Traffic
coming from the fabric is directly mirrored from the NIC itself and
there is no additional mirroring need in vRouter.  The programming
of the NIC itself for appropriate mirroring is outside the scope of
the current activity. An example is the Niantic 82599 10G NIC, which
supports VLAN port mirroring options.</p><p>The following are cautions to observe when using NIC-assisted
mirroring:</p><ul><li style=""><p>VM traffic sent to another VM running on the same compute
node will not be mirrored when NIC-assisted mirroring is selected.</p></li><li style=""><p>Traffic coming in from the fabric interface will not be
mirrored.</p></li><li style=""><p>When a VLAN interface is used as the fabric interface,
traffic will be tagged first with the NIC-assisted mirroring VLAN,
followed by the VLAN tag on the fabric interface. The NIC-assisted
mirroring VLAN will be the inner tag and the fabric interface VLAN
will be the outer tag.</p></li></ul><p>The NIC must be programmed for VLAN port mirroring. While configuring
mirroring in Contrail, the user can indicate NIC-assisted mirroring
with the VLAN tag. The Contrail UI supports NIC-assisted mirroring
configuration in the Ports page and in the Policies page with an additional
flag for NIC-assisted mirroring and the VLAN tag to be used.</p><sw-prev-next> </sw-prev-next></p>
