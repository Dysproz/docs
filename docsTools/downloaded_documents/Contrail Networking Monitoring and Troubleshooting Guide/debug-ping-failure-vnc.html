for resolving reachability issues (ping failures) when working with
policy-connected virtual networks.</p><p>These are the methods used to configure reachability
for a virtual network or virtual machine:</p><ul><li style=""><p>Use network policy to exchange virtual network routes. </p></li><li style=""><p>Use a floating IP address pool to associate an IP address
from a destination virtual network to virtual machine(s) in the source
virtual network. </p></li><li style=""><p>Use an ASN/RT configuration to exchange virtual network
routes with an MX Series router gateway. </p></li><li style=""><p>Use a service instance static route configuration to route
between service instances in two virtual networks.</p></li></ul><p>This topic focuses on troubleshooting reachability for the first
method --- using network policy to exchange routes between virtual
networks.</p><p><em>Troubleshooting Procedure for Policy-Connected

experiencing ping failures on virtual network routes that are connected
by means of network policy. </p><p> Check the network policy configuration:  </p><ul><li style=""><p>Verify that the policy is attached to each of the virtual
networks. </p></li><li style=""><p>Each attached policy should have either an explicit rule
allowing traffic from one virtual network to the other, or an allow
all traffic rule. </p></li><li style=""><p>Verify that the order of the actions in the policy rules
is correct,  because the actions are applied in the order in which
they are listed. </p></li><li style=""><p>If there are multiple policies attached to a virtual network,
verify that the policies are attached in a logical order. The first
policy listed is applied first, and its rules are applied first, then
the next policy is applied.  </p></li><li style=""><p>Finally, if either of the virtual networks does not have
an explicit rule to allow traffic from the other virtual network,
the traffic flow will be treated as an <strong v-pre="">UNRESOLVED</strong> or <strong v-pre="">SHORT</strong> flow and all packets will be dropped.</p></li></ul><p>Use the following sequence in the Contrail UI to check policies,
attachments, and traffic rules:  </p><p>Check VN1-VN2 ACL information from the compute node:</p><figure id="jd0e112"><figcaption>Figure 3: Policies, Attachments, and Traffic Rule Status Window</figcaption><div class="graphic"><img alt="Policies, Attachments, and Traffic Rule Status Window" src="images/s041982.gif" style=""/></div></figure><p>Check the virtual network policy configuration with route information:</p><figure id="jd0e118"><figcaption>Figure 4: Virtual Network Policy Configuration Window</figcaption><div class="graphic"><img alt="Virtual Network Policy Configuration Window" src="images/s041983.gif" style=""/></div></figure><p>Check the VN1 route information for VN2 routes:</p><figure id="jd0e124"><figcaption>Figure 5: Virtual Network Route Information Window</figcaption><div class="graphic"><img alt="Virtual Network Route Information Window" src="images/s041984.gif" style=""/></div></figure><p>If a route is missing, ping fails.

any protocol-specific action, where routes are exchanged, but only

routing. However, in a complex system, a virtual network might have
one or more configuration methods combined that influence reachability
and routing.</p><p>For example, an environment might have a virtual network VN-X
configured with policy-based routing to another virtual network VN-Y.
At the same time, there are a few virtual machines in VN-X that have
a floating IP to another virtual network VN-Z, which is connected
to VN-XX via a NAT service instance.  This is a complex scenario,
and you need to debug step-by-step, taking into account all of the
features working together. </p><p>Additionally, there are other considerations beyond routing
and reachability that can affect traffic flow. For example, the rules
of network policies and security groups can affect traffic to the
destination. Also, if multi-path is involved, then ECMP and RPF need
to be taken into account while debugging.</p><sw-prev-next> </sw-prev-next></p>
