OpenStack</h2><p>Contrail virtual networks are isolated by default. Workloads
in a virtual network cannot communicate with workloads in other virtual
networks, by default. A neutron router or a Contrail network policy
may be used to connect two virtual networks. In addition, Contrail
network policy also provides security between two virtual networks
by allowing or denying specified traffic.</p><p>OpenStack security groups allow access between workloads and
instances for specified traffic types and any other types are denied. </p><p>A security policy model for any given customer first needs to
map to the OpenStack network policy framework and security group constructs. </p><p>In modern cloud environments, workloads are moving from one
server to another, one rack to another and so on. Therefore, users
must rely less on using IP addresses or other network coordinates
to identify the endpoints to be protected. Instead users must leverage
application attributes to author policies, so that the policies don't
need to be updated on account of workload mobility. </p><p>You might want to segregate traffic based on the different categories
of data origination, such as: </p><ul><li style=""><p>Protecting the application itself</p></li><li style=""><p>Segregating traffic for specific component tiers within
the application</p></li><li style=""><p>Segregating traffic based on the deployment environment
for the application instance</p></li><li style=""><p>Segregating traffic based on the specific geographic location
where the application is deployed</p></li></ul><p>There are many other possible scenarios where traffic needs
to be segregated.</p><p>Additionally, you might need to group workloads based on combinations
of tags. These intents are hard to express with existing network policy
constructs or Security Group constructs. Besides, existing policy
constructs leveraging the network coordinates, must continually be
rewritten or updated each time workloads move and their associated
network coordinates change. </p><h2 id="jd0e43">Security Policy Enhancements</h2><p>As the Contrail environment has grown and become more complex,
it has become harder to achieve desired security results with the
existing network policy and security group constructs. The Contrail
network policies have been tied to routing, making it difficult to
express security policies for environments such as cross sectioning
between categories, or having a multi-tier application supporting
development and production environment workloads with no cross environment
traffic.</p><p>Starting with Release 5.1, Contrail Networking supports the
OpenStack Neutron Firewall version 2 API extension known as Neutron
FWaaS (Firewall as a Service). The Neutron API enhancements make the
existing FWaaS more granular by giving you the ability to apply the
firewall rules at the port level rather than at the router level,
and to have different firewall policies with different rules applied
to inbound versus outbound connections. Support is extended to various
types of Neutron ports, including VM ports and SFC ports as well as
router ports. It also provides better grouping mechanisms (firewall
groups, address groups and service groups). Finally, the Firewall
Group enables firewall policies to be bound to Neutron ports.</p><p>Related enhancements to the OpenStack Neutron and Contrail security
groups API include:</p><ul><li style=""><p>Firewall rules support deny, reject, description, and
admin status attributes</p></li><li style=""><p>A share attribute for firewall rules allow them to be
shared between different projects</p></li><li style=""><p>Filtering based on the source and destination address
prefix and port rather than just the remote destination</p></li><li style=""><p>Firewall groups reference firewall rules through a firewall
policy, allowing reuse of shareable firewall policies that are referenced
by multiple firewall groups</p></li></ul><h2 id="jd0e65">Configuration Objects</h2><p>The following are the configuration objects for the new security
features.</p><ul><li style=""><p>firewall-policy</p></li><li style=""><p>firewall-rule </p></li><li style=""><p>policy-management</p></li><li style=""><p>application-policy </p></li><li style=""><p>service-group</p></li><li style=""><p>address-group</p></li><li style=""><p>tag</p></li><li style=""><p>global-application-policy</p></li></ul><p>For more information
