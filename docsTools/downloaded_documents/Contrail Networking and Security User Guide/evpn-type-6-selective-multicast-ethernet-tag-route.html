<p id="topic-content"><h1 id="jd0e2">Support for EVPN Type 6 Selective Multicast Ethernet Tag Route</h1><sw-topic-details date="2019-05-13"> </sw-topic-details><p>Contrail Release 5.1 supports EVPN Type 6 selective multicast
Ethernet tag (SMET) route to selectively send or receive traffic based
on the presence or absence of active receivers on a compute node.
The EVPN Type-6 SMET route helps build and use multicast trees selectively
on a per <span class="cli" v-pre="">&lt;*, G&gt;</span> basis.</p><p>Currently, all broadcast, unknown unicast, multicast (BUM) traffic
is carried over the inclusive multicast ethernet tag (IMET) routes.
This results in flooding of all compute nodes irrespective of whether
an active receiver is present or not on each of those compute-nodes. </p><h2 id="jd0e16">Configuring EVPN Type-6 SMET Routes</h2><p>EVPN Type-6 SMET routes capability attaches a specific BGP community
attribute <span class="cli" v-pre="">Ethernet Multicast flags Community</span> (<span class="cli" v-pre="">MF</span>) to the IMET routes. This community is advertised by default in
Contrail release 5.1 and later. You must enable IGMP on the network
as shown in <a href="evpn-type-6-selective-multicast-ethernet-tag-route.html#configure-igmp">Figure 1</a> as well as on the
QFX device to which the multicast source is connected. You can configure
IGMP at the global system configuration-level, at virtual network-level,
or at VMI-level. Configuring <span class="cli" v-pre="">ERB-UCAST-Gateway</span> role enables
IGMP snooping on the QFX device.</p><figure id="configure-igmp"><figcaption>Figure 1: Configure IGMP</figcaption><div class="graphic"><img alt="Configure IGMP" src="documentation/images/s008005.png" style=""/></div></figure><p>You can allow or deny multicast traffic by attaching a policy
at the virtual network-level as shown in <a href="evpn-type-6-selective-multicast-ethernet-tag-route.html#define-multicast-policy">Figure 2</a>.</p><figure id="define-multicast-policy"><figcaption>Figure 2:  Define Multicast Policy</figcaption><div class="graphic"><img alt=" Define Multicast Policy" src="documentation/images/s008006.png" style=""/></div></figure><p>In Contrail Release 5.1, the receivers are always inside the
contrail cluster and sender is always outside the cluster. This feature
is supported only with  &lt;*, G&gt;  /igmpv2. The SMET feature is supported
only on QFX10000 and QFX5110 devices running Junos OS Release 18.4R1
and later.</p><sw-prev-next> </sw-prev-next></p>
