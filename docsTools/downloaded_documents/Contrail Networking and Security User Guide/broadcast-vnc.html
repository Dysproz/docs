supports broadcast and multicast.</p></div></div><h2 id="jd0e16">Subnet Broadcast</h2><p>Multiple subnets can be
attached to a virtual network when it is spawned. Each of the subnets
has one subnet broadcast route installed in the unicast routing table
assigned to that virtual network. The recipient list for the subnet
broadcast route includes all of the virtual machines that belong to
that subnet. Packets originating from any VM in that subnet are replicated
to all members of the recipient list, except the originator. Because
the next hop is the list of recipients, it is called a composite next
hop. </p><p>If there is no virtual machine spawned under a subnet, the subnet
routing entry discards the packets received. If all of the virtual
machines in a subnet are turned off, the routing entry points to discard.
If the IPAM is deleted, the subnet route corresponding to that IPAM
is deleted. If the virtual network is turned off, all of the subnet
routes associated with the virtual network are removed.</p><p><em>Subnet Broadcast Example</em></p><p>The following configuration is made:</p><ul><li class="unmarked-list" style=""><p>Virtual network name – <strong v-pre="">vn1</strong></p></li><li class="unmarked-list" style=""><p>Unicast routing instance – <code class="inline" v-pre="">vn1.uc.inet </code></p></li><li class="unmarked-list" style=""><p>Subnets (IPAM) allocated – <code class="inline" v-pre="">1.1.1.0/24;
2.2.0.0/16; 3.3.0.0/16 </code></p></li><li class="unmarked-list" style=""><p>Virtual machines spawned – <code class="inline" v-pre="">vm1 (1.1.1.253);
vm2 (1.1.1.252); vm3 (1.1.1.251); vm4 (3.3.1.253)</code></p></li></ul><p>The following subnet route additions are made to the routing
instance <code class="inline" v-pre="">vn1.uc.inet.0</code>:</p><ul><li class="unmarked-list" style=""><p><code class="inline" v-pre="">1.1.1.255</code> -&gt; forward to NH1
(composite next hop)</p></li><li class="unmarked-list" style=""><p><code class="inline" v-pre="">2.2.255.255</code> -&gt; DROP</p></li><li class="unmarked-list" style=""><p><code class="inline" v-pre="">3.3.255.255</code> -&gt; forward to NH2</p></li><li class="unmarked-list" style=""><p>The following entries are made to the next-hop table:</p></li><li class="unmarked-list" style=""><p>NH1 – <code class="inline" v-pre="">1.1.1.253; 1.1.1.252; 1.1.1.251 </code></p></li><li class="unmarked-list" style=""><p>NH2 – <code class="inline" v-pre="">3.3.1.253</code></p></li></ul><p>If traffic originates for <code class="inline" v-pre="">1.1.1.255</code> from <code class="inline" v-pre="">vm1 (1.1.1.253)</code>, it will be forwarded
to <code class="inline" v-pre="">vm2 (1.1.1.252)</code> and <code class="inline" v-pre="">vm3
(1.1.1.251)</code>. The originator <code class="inline" v-pre="">vm1 (1.1.1.253)</code> will not receive the traffic even though it is listed as a recipient
in the next hop. </p><h2 id="jd0e105">All-Broadcast/Limited-Broadcast and Link-Local Multicast</h2><p>The address group <code class="inline" v-pre="">255.255.255.255</code> is used with all-broadcast (limited-broadcast) and multicast traffic.
The route is installed in the multicast routing instance. The source
address is recorded as ANY, so the route is <code class="inline" v-pre="">ANY/255.255.255.255
(*,G)</code>. It is unique per routing instance, and is associated
with its corresponding virtual network. When a virtual network is
spawned, it usually contains multiple subnets, in which virtual machines
are added. All of the virtual machines, regardless of their subnets,
are part of the recipient list for <code class="inline" v-pre="">ANY/255.255.255.255</code>. The replication is sent to every recipient except the originator. </p><p>Link-local multicast also uses the all-broadcast method for
replication. The route is deleted when all virtual machines in this
virtual network are turned off or the virtual network itself is deleted.</p><p><em>All-Broadcast Example</em></p><p>The following configuration is made:</p><ul><li class="unmarked-list" style=""><p>Virtual network name – <code class="inline" v-pre="">vn1</code></p></li><li class="unmarked-list" style=""><p>Unicast routing instance – <code class="inline" v-pre="">vn1.uc.inet</code></p></li><li class="unmarked-list" style=""><p>Subnets (IPAM) allocated – <code class="inline" v-pre="">1.1.1.0/24;

vm2 (1.1.1.252); vm3 (1.1.1.251); vm4 (3.3.1.253)</code></p></li></ul><p>The following subnet route addition is made to the routing instance <code class="inline" v-pre="">vn1.uc.inet.0</code>:</p><ul><li class="unmarked-list" style=""><p><code class="inline" v-pre="">255.255.255.255/*</code> -&gt; NH1</p></li></ul><p>The following entries are made to the next-hop table:</p><ul><li class="unmarked-list" style=""><p>NH1 – <code class="inline" v-pre="">1.1.1.253; 1.1.1.252; 1.1.1.251;
3.3.1.253 </code></p></li></ul><p>If traffic originates for <code class="inline" v-pre="">1.1.1.255</code> from <code class="inline" v-pre="">vm1 (1.1.1.253)</code>, the traffic is
forwarded to <code class="inline" v-pre="">vm2 (1.1.1.252), vm3 (1.1.1.251)</code>, and <code class="inline" v-pre="">vm4 (3.3.1.253)</code>. The originator <code class="inline" v-pre="">vm1 (1.1.1.253)</code> will not receive the traffic even though
it is listed as a recipient in the next hop. </p><h2 id="jd0e187">Host Broadcast</h2><p>The host broadcast route is present in the host routing instance
so that the host operating system can send a subnet broadcast/all-broadcast
(limited-broadcast). This type of broadcast is sent to the fabric
by means of a <strong v-pre="">vhost</strong> interface. Additionally, any subnet
broadcast/all-broadcast received from the fabric will be handed over
to the host operating system.</p><sw-prev-next> </sw-prev-next></p>
