<p id="topic-content"><h1 id="jd0e2">Support for L3VPN Inter AS Option C</h1><sw-topic-details date="2019-05-28"> </sw-topic-details><p>Contrail Release 5.1 and later supports L3VPN inter AS Option
C, which is used to interconnect multi-AS backbones as described in
RFC 4364. Inter-AS option C uses BGP as the label distribution protocol.
Labeled IPv4 routes are redistributed by eBGP between the neighboring
autonomous systems. A new address family inet-labeled is added to
maintain labeled unicast routes. This table is used for resolving
L3VPN routes which are encapsulated using MPLS. <a href="contrail-inter-as-option-c.html#l3vpn-interas-option-c">Figure 1</a> shows the connectivity and
the roles of different components in this architecture.  </p><figure id="l3vpn-interas-option-c"><figcaption>Figure 1: L3VPN Inter AS Option C

Architecture" src="documentation/images/g300379.png" style=""/></div></figure><p>The controller maintains an eBGP session with the SDN-GW router
and an iBGP session with the ASBR router. The controller exchanges
labeled routes with the vRouters over XMPP. The vRouter uses MPLSoUDP
or MPLSoGRE to reach the ASBR and encapsulates two labels within it
- the inner VPN label and outer BGP-LU label. For the opposite direction,
the vRouter  advertises a labeled unicast route for its vhost address
with a label 3 (implicit null), so  the traffic from the ASBR delivered
through the fabric to the vRouter over a UDP/GRE tunnel contains only
the VPN label. </p><h2 id="jd0e19">Configuring Inter AS Option C</h2><p>This section describes how to configure L3VPN Inter AS Option
