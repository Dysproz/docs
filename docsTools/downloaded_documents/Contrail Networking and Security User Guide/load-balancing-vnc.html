by distributing traffic streams to multiple service virtual machines
(VMs) that are running identical applications. This is illustrated
in <a href="load-balancing-vnc.html#load-balance">Figure 1</a>, where the traffic streams between
VM-A and VM-B are distributed between Service VM-1 and Service VM-2.
If Service VM-1 goes down, then all streams that are dependent on
Service VM-1 will be moved to Service VM-2.</p><figure id="load-balance"><figcaption>Figure 1: Load Balancing a Service Chain</figcaption><div class="graphic"><img alt="Load Balancing a Service Chain" src="images/s041830.gif" style=""/></div></figure><p>The following are the major features of load balancing
in the service chain:</p><ul><li style=""><p>Load balancing can be configured at every level of the
service chain.</p></li><li style=""><p>Load balancing is supported in routed and bridged service
chain modes.</p></li><li style=""><p>Load balancing can be used to achieve high availability—if
a service VM goes down, the traffic passing through that service VM
can be distributed through another service VM.</p></li><li style=""><p>A load balanced traffic stream always follows the same
path through the chain of service VM.</p></li></ul><sw-prev-next> </sw-prev-next></p>
