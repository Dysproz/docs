traffic to a service virtual machine.  </p><p>The following figure shows a virtual network with subnet 10.1.1.0/24.
All of the traffic from a virtual machine that is directed to subnet
11.1.1.0/24 can be configured to be routed by means of a service machine,
by using the static route 11.1.1.252 configured on the service virtual
machine interface. </p><h2 id="jd0e22">Configuring Static Routes on a Service Instance</h2><p>To configure static routes on a service instance, first
enable the static route option in the service template to be used
for the service instance.</p><p>To enable the static route option in a service template:</p><ol type="1"><li id="jd0e33" style="">Go to <strong v-pre="">Configure &gt; Services &gt; Service Templates</strong> and click <strong v-pre="">Create</strong>. </li><li id="jd0e42" style="">At <strong v-pre="">Add Service Template</strong>, complete the fields
for <strong v-pre="">Name</strong>, <strong v-pre="">Service Mode</strong>, and <strong v-pre="">Image Name</strong>.</li><li id="jd0e57" style="">Select the <strong v-pre="">Interface Types</strong> to use for the template,
then for each interface type that might have a static route configured,
click the check box under the <strong v-pre="">Static Routes </strong>column to enable
the static route option for that interface. <p>The following figure shows a service template in which the left
and right interfaces of service instances have the static routes option
enabled. Now a user can configure a static route on a corresponding
interface on a service instance that is based on the service template
shown. </p></li></ol><figure id="jd0e68"><div class="graphic"><img alt="" src="documentation/images/s041915.gif" style=""/></div></figure><h2 id="jd0e71">Configuring Static Routes on Service Instance Interfaces </h2><p>To configure static routes on a service instance interface:</p><ol type="1"><li id="jd0e79" style="">Go to <strong v-pre="">Configure &gt; Services &gt; Service Instances</strong> and click <strong v-pre="">Create</strong>. </li><li id="jd0e88" style="">At <strong v-pre="">Create Service Instances</strong>, complete the fields

each interface field for which the static routes option is enabled
to open the <strong v-pre="">Static Routes </strong>menu and configure the static
routes in the fields provided.<sw-admonition name="note" style=""><strong class="title">Note</strong><p>If the <strong v-pre="">Auto Configured</strong> option is selected,
traffic destined to the static route subnet is load balanced across
service instances. </p></sw-admonition></li></ol><p>The following figure shows a configuration to apply a service
instance between VN1 (10.1.1.0/24) and VN2 (11.1.1.0/24). The left
interface of the service instance is configured with VN1 and the right
interface is configured to be VN2 (11.1.1.0/24). The static route
11.1.1.0/24 is configured on the left interface, so that all traffic
from VN1 that is destined to VN2 reaches the left interface of the
service instance.</p><figure id="jd0e120"><div class="graphic"><img alt="" src="documentation/images/s041916.gif" style=""/></div></figure><p>The following figure shows static route 10.1.1.0/24 configured
on the right interface, so that all traffic from VN2 that is destined
to VN1 reaches the right interface of the service virtual machine. </p><figure id="jd0e124"><div class="graphic"><img alt="" src="documentation/images/s041917.gif" style=""/></div></figure><p>When the static routes are configured for both the left and
the right interfaces, all inter-virtual network traffic is forwarded
through the service instance.</p><h2 id="jd0e129">Configuring Static Routes as Host Routes </h2><p>You can also use static routes for host routes for a virtual
machine, by using the classless static routes option in the DHCP server
response that is sent to the virtual machine. </p><p>The routes to be sent in the DHCP response to the virtual machine
can be configured for each virtual network as it is created.</p><p>To configure static routes as host routes:</p><ol type="1"><li id="jd0e141" style="">Go to <strong v-pre="">Configure</strong> <strong v-pre="">&gt; Network &gt; Networks</strong> and click <strong v-pre="">Create</strong>.</li><li id="jd0e153" style="">At <strong v-pre="">Create Network</strong>, click the <strong v-pre="">Host Routes</strong> option and add the host routes to be sent to the virtual machines. <p>An example is shown in the following figure.</p></li></ol><figure id="jd0e164"><div class="graphic"><img alt="" src="documentation/images/s041918.gif" style=""/></div></figure><sw-prev-next> </sw-prev-next></p>
