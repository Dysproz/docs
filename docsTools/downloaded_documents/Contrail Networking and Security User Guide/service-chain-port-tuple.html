a port-tuple object for binding service instances to ports.</p></div></div><h2 id="jd0e15">Overview of Port Tuple</h2><p>In previous versions of Contrail, when a service instance is
created for a virtual machine (VM)-based service, the service monitor
creates one or more VM objects and creates a port for each VM object.
Each VM object is a placeholder for binding a service instance to
a port. The VM object also acts as a placeholder for the instance
ID when using equal-cost multipath (ECMP). </p><p>Using the VM object as a placeholder doesn't add value beyond
binding information between the service instance object and the port
objects. By using a port-tuple object, the service instance can be
linked directly to the port objects, eliminating the need to create
a VM object. This simplifies the implementation of service instance
objects, and also allows integration with Heat templates.</p><p>With a port-tuple object, the user can create ports and pass
the port information when creating a service instance. The ports can
be created as part of a VM launch from Nova or without using a VM
launch. The ports are linked to a port-tuple object that is a child
of a service instance. This functionality can also be leveraged in
Heat stacks. See <a href="service-chain-port-tuple.html#tuple1">Figure 1</a>.</p><figure id="tuple1"><figcaption>Figure 1: Port Tuple Overview</figcaption><div class="graphic"><img alt="Port Tuple Overview" src="images/s018749.png" style=""/></div></figure><h2 id="jd0e30">Service Chain Version 2 Sample Workflow</h2><p>With Contrail service templates Version 2, the user can create
ports and bind them to a VM-based or container-based service instance,
by means of a port-tuple object. All objects created with the Version
2 service template are visible to the Contrail Heat engine, and are
managed by Heat. </p><p>The following shows the basic workflow steps for creating a
port tuple and service instance that will be managed by Heat:</p><ol type="1"><li id="jd0e39" style="">Create a service template. Select 2 in the Version field. </li><li id="jd0e42" style="">Create a service instance for the service template just
created.</li><li id="jd0e45" style="">Create a port-tuple object.</li><li id="jd0e48" style="">Create ports, using Nova VM launch or without a VM launch. </li><li id="jd0e51" style="">Label each port as <code class="inline" v-pre="">left, right, mgmt</code>, and so on, and add the ports to the port-tuple object.<p>Use a unique label for each of the ports in a single port tuple.
The labels <code class="inline" v-pre="">left</code> and <code class="inline" v-pre="">right</code> are used for forwarding.</p></li><li id="jd0e65" style="">Link the port tuple to a service instance.</li><li id="jd0e68" style="">Launch the service instance. This creates the necessary
objects in the Contrail database.</li></ol><sw-admonition name="note" style=""><strong class="title">Note</strong><p>Port-tuple is <em>not</em> supported on transparent
service instance, whether active/active, active/standby, or scale-out.</p></sw-admonition><h3 id="jd0e77">Service Chain with Equal-Cost Multipath in Active-Active Mode</h3><p>Equal-cost multipath (ECMP) can be used to distribute traffic
across VMs. To support ECMP in the service chain, create multiple
port tuples within the same service instance. The labels should be
the same for the VM ports in each port tuple. For example, if port
tuple 1 uses the labels <code class="inline" v-pre="">left</code> and <code class="inline" v-pre="">right</code>, then port tuple 2 in the same service instance
should also use the labels <code class="inline" v-pre="">left</code> and <code class="inline" v-pre="">right</code> for its ports. </p><p>When there are multiple port tuples, the default mode of operation
is <code class="inline" v-pre="">active-active</code>. </p><h3 id="jd0e99">Service Chain Active-Standby Mode with Allowed Address Pair</h3><p>To support <code class="inline" v-pre="">active-standby</code> mode, you
must configure an allowed address pair on the interfaces. The <code class="inline" v-pre="">active-standby</code> is used as the high availability mode
in the allowed address pair. The allowed address pair is configured
as part of the service instance for a particular VM port label. For
example, if the allowed address pair is configured in a service instance
for the port with the label <code class="inline" v-pre="">left</code>, then
all of the port-tuple VM ports with the label <code class="inline" v-pre="">left</code> will use the allowed address pair high availability mode. </p><h4 id="jd0e116">Allowed Address Pair</h4><p>An allowed address pair extension is an OpenStack feature supported
by Contrail. </p><p>By default, there is no way to specify additional MAC/IP address
pairs that are allowed to pass through a port in Neutron, because
ports are locked down to their MAC address and the fixed IPs associated
with their port for anti-spoofing reasons. This locking can sometimes
prevent protocols such as VRRP from providing a high availability
failover strategy. Using the allowed address pair extension enables
additional IP/MAC pairs to be allowed through ports in Neutron. </p><p>In Contrail, you can configure allowed address pairs in the
service instance configuration, using <strong v-pre="">Configure &gt; Services &gt;
Service Instances &gt; Allowed Address Pair</strong>, see <a href="service-chain-port-tuple.html#aap">Figure 2</a>.</p><figure id="aap"><figcaption>Figure 2: Edit Service Instance, Allowed Address Pair</figcaption><div class="graphic"><img alt="Edit Service Instance, Allowed Address Pair" src="images/s019908.png" style=""/></div></figure><p>For more information about OpenStack allowed address pairs,

A static route table is configured similar to how the allowed address
pair is configured, except with using the label <code class="inline" v-pre="">right</code>. The route table will be attached to the correct VM ports of the
port tuples, based on the configuration of the port with the label <code class="inline" v-pre="">right</code>. </p><h2 id="jd0e150">Service Chain with Health Check</h2><p>Service chain Version 2 also allows service instance health
check configuration on a per interface label. This is used to monitor
the health of the service. </p><p>For more information about the service instance health check,
