<p id="topic-content"><h1 id="jd0e2">Security Policy Features</h1><sw-topic-details date="2019-04-16"> </sw-topic-details><h2 id="jd0e12">Overview of Existing Network Policy and Security Groups in Contrail</h2><p>Contrail virtual networks are isolated by default. Workloads
in a virtual network cannot communicate with workloads in other virtual
networks, by default. A Contrail network policy may be used
to connect two virtual networks. In addition, Contrail network policy
also provides security between two virtual networks by allowing or
denying specified traffic.</p><p>In modern cloud environments, workloads are moving from one
server to another, one rack to another and so on. Therefore, users
must rely less on using IP addresses or other network coordinates
to identify the endpoints to be protected. Instead users must leverage
application attributes to author policies, so that the policies don't
need to be updated on account of workload mobility. </p><p>You might want to segregate traffic based on the different categories
of data origination, such as: </p><ul><li style=""><p>Protecting the application itself</p></li><li style=""><p>Segregating traffic for specific component tiers within
the application</p></li><li style=""><p>Segregating traffic based on the deployment environment
for the application instance</p></li><li style=""><p>Segregating traffic based on the specific geographic location
where the application is deployed</p></li></ul><p>There are many other possible scenarios where traffic needs
to be segregated.</p><p>Additionally, you might need to group workloads based on combinations
of tags. These intents are hard to express with existing network policy
constructs or Security Group constructs. Besides, existing policy
constructs leveraging the network coordinates, must continually be
rewritten or updated each time workloads move and their associated
network coordinates change. </p><h2 id="jd0e39">Security Policy Enhancements</h2><p>As the Contrail environment has grown and become more complex,
it has become harder to achieve desired security results with the
existing network policy and security group constructs. The Contrail
network policies have been tied to routing, making it difficult to
express security policies for environments such as cross sectioning
between categories, or having a multi-tier application supporting
development and production environment workloads with no cross environment
traffic.</p><p>Starting with Contrail Release 4.1, limitations of the current
network policy and security group constructs are addressed by supporting
decoupling of routing from security policies, multidimension segmentation,
and policy portability. This release also enhances user visibility
and analytics functions for security.</p><p>Contrail Release 4.1 introduces new firewall security policy
objects, including the following enhancements:</p><ul><li style=""><p>Routing and policy decoupling—introducing new firewall
policy objects, which decouples policy from routing.</p></li><li style=""><p>Multidimension segmentation—segment traffic and
add security features, based on multiple dimensions of entities, such
as application, tier, deployment, site, usergroup, and so on.</p></li><li style=""><p>Policy portability—security policies can be ported
to different environments, such as ‘from development to production’,
‘from pci-complaint to production’, ‘to bare metal
environment’ and ‘to container environment’. </p></li><li style=""><p>Visibility and analytics</p></li></ul><h2 id="jd0e61">Using Tags and Configuration Objects to Enhance Security Policy</h2><p>Starting with Contrail Release 4.1, tags and configuration objects
are used to create new firewall policy objects that decouple routing
and network policies, enabling multidimension segmentation and policy
portability.</p><p>Multidimension traffic segmentation helps you segment traffic
based on dimensions such as application, tier, deployment, site, and
usergroup. </p><p>You can also port security policies to different environments.
Portability of policies are enabled by providing match conditions
for tags. Match tags must be added to the policy rule to match tag
values of source and destination workloads without mentioning tag
values. For example, in order for the <code class="inline" v-pre="">‘allow protocol
tcp source application-tier=web destination application-tier=application
match application and site’</code> rule to take effect,
the application and site values must match. </p><h3 id="jd0e73">Predefined Tags</h3><p>You can choose predefined tags based on the environment and
deployment requirements. </p><p>Predefined tags include:</p><ul><li style=""><p>application</p></li><li style=""><p>application-tier </p></li><li style=""><p>deployment</p></li><li style=""><p>site </p></li><li style=""><p>label (a special tag that allows the user to label objects)</p></li></ul><h4 id="jd0e97">Custom Tags</h4><p>You can also define custom tags for a Kubernetes environment.
You can define tags in the UI or upload configurations in JSON format.</p><h4 id="jd0e102">Example Tag Usage</h4><p><code class="inline" v-pre="">application = HRApp application-tier = Web site
= USA</code></p><h3 id="jd0e108">Tagging Objects</h3><p>A user can tag the objects project, VN, VM, and VMI with tags
and values to map their security requirements. Tags follow the hierarchy
of project, VN, VM and VMI and are inherited in that order. This gives
an option for the user to provide default settings for any tags at
any level. Policies can specify their security in terms of tagged
endpoints, in addition to expressing in terms of ip prefix, network,
and address groups endpoints.</p><h3 id="jd0e113">Policy Application</h3><p>Policy application is a new object, implemented by means of
the application tag. The user can create a list of policies per application
to be applied during the flow acceptance evaluation. Introducing global
scoped policies and project scoped policies. There are global scoped
policies, which can be applied globally for all projects, and project
scoped policies, which are applied to specific projects. </p><h2 id="jd0e118">Configuration Objects</h2><p>The following are the configuration objects for the new security
features.</p><ul><li style=""><p>firewall-policy</p></li><li style=""><p>firewall-rule </p></li><li style=""><p>policy-management</p></li><li style=""><p>application-policy </p></li><li style=""><p>service-group</p></li><li style=""><p>address-group</p></li><li style=""><p>tag</p></li><li style=""><p>global-application-policy</p></li></ul><h3 id="jd0e149">Configuration Object Tag Object</h3><p>Each configuration object tag object contains:</p><ul><li style=""><p>tag: one of the defined tag types, stored as string and
a 32-bit ID. </p></li><li style=""><p>tag type: Contains the type string and ID (the first 16
bits of the tag) and references to the tag resource type</p></li></ul><p>Each value entered by the user creates a unique ID that is set
in the tag_id field. The system can have up to 64 million tag values.
On average, each tag can have up to 2k values, but there are no restrictions
per tag. </p><p>Tags and labels can be attached to any object, for example,
project, VN, VM, VMI, and policy, and these objects have a tag reference
list to support multiple tags. </p><p>RBAC controls the users allowed to modify or remove attached
tags. Some tags (typically facts) are attached by the system by default
or by means of introspection.</p><h4 id="jd0e168">Tag APIs</h4><p>Tag APIs are used to give RBAC per tag in any object (VMI, VM,
Project ….). </p><ul><li style=""><p>REST: <code class="inline" v-pre="">HTTP POST to /set_tag_&lt;tag_type&gt;/&lt;obj_uuid&gt;</code></p></li><li style=""><p>Python: <code class="inline" v-pre="">set_tag_&lt;tag_type&gt; (object_type,
object_uuid, tag_value) </code></p></li></ul><p>Configuration also supports the following APIs:</p><ul><li style=""><p>tag query</p></li><li style=""><p>tags (policy)</p></li><li style=""><p>tags (application tag) </p></li><li style=""><p>object query</p></li><li style=""><p>tags (object) </p></li><li style=""><p>tags (type, value) </p></li></ul><h4 id="jd0e205">Label</h4><p>Label is special tag type, used to assign labels for objects.
All of the tag constructs are valid, except that tag type is ‘label'.
One difference from other tags is that an object can have any number
of labels. All other tag types are restricted to one tag per object. </p><h4 id="jd0e210">Local and Global Tags</h4><p>Tags can be defined globally or locally under a project; tag
objects are children of either config-root or a project. An object
can be tagged with a tag in its project or with a globally-scoped
tag. </p><h4 id="jd0e215">Analytics</h4><p>When given a tag query with a SQL where clause and select clause,
analytics should give out objects. The query can also contain labels,
and the labels can have different operators. </p><p>Example: </p><p>User might want to know: a list of VMIs where <code class="inline" v-pre="">’site
== USA and deployment == Production'</code></p><p> list of VMIs where <code class="inline" v-pre="">’site == USA and deployment
== Production has ’ </code></p><p>Given tag SQL where clause and select clause, analytics should
give out flows.</p><h4 id="jd0e232">Control Node </h4><p>The control node passes the tags, along with route updates,
to agents and other control nodes. </p><h4 id="jd0e237">Agent</h4><p>Agent gets attached tags along with configuration objects. Agent
also gets route updates containing tags associated with IP route.
This process is similar to getting security group IDs along with the
route update.</p><h3 id="jd0e242">Address-Group Configuration Object</h3><p>There are multiple ways to add IP address to address-group.</p><ul><li style=""><p>Manually add IP prefixes to the address-group by means
of configuration.</p></li><li style=""><p>Label a work load with the address-group’s specified
label. All ports that are labelled with the same label are considered
to be part of that address-group. </p></li><li style=""><p>Use introspect workloads, based on certain criteria, to
add ip-address to address-group. </p></li></ul><h4 id="jd0e258">Configuration</h4><p>The address-group object refers to a label object, description,
and list of IP prefixes. The label - object is created using the tag
APIs. </p><h4 id="jd0e263">Agent</h4><p>Agent gets address-group and label objects referenced in policy
configuration. Agent uses this address group for matching policy rules. </p><h4 id="jd0e268">Analytics</h4><p>When given address group label, analytics gets all the objects
associated with it. Given address group label, get all the flows associated
with it.</p><h3 id="jd0e273">Service-Group Configuration Object</h3><p>Configuration </p><p>The service-group contains a list of ports and protocols. The
open stack service-group has a list of service objects; the service
object contains attributes: id, name, service group id, protocol,
source_port, destination_port, icmp_code, icmp_type, timeout, tenant
id.</p><p>Agent </p><p>Agent gets service-group object as it is referred to in a policy
rule. Agent uses this service group during policy evaluation.</p><h3 id="jd0e284">Application-policy-set Configuration Object</h3><p>The application-policy-set configuration object can refer to
a tag of type application, network-policy objects, and firewall-policy
objects. This object can be local (project) or globally scoped. </p><p>When an application tag is attached to an application-policy-set
object, the policies referred by that object are automatically applied
to the ports that have the same application tag. </p><p>Any firewall-policies referred by the application-policy-set
objects are ordered using sequence numbers. If the same application
tag is attached to multiple application-policy-sets, all those sets
will apply, but order among those sets is undefined. </p><p>One application-policy-set (called default-policy-application-set)
is special in that policies referred by it are applied to all interfaces
by default, after applying policies referred to other application-policy-sets. </p><p>Upon seeing the application tag for any object, the associated
policies are sent to agent. Agent will use this information to find
out the list of policies to be applied and their sequence during flow
evaluation. User can attach application tag to allowed objects (Project,
VN, VM or VMI).</p><h3 id="jd0e297">Policy-management Configuration Object</h3><p>Policy-management is a global container object for all policy-related
configuration. </p><p>Policy-management object contains</p><ul><li style=""><p>network-policies (NPs)</p></li><li style=""><p>firewall-policies (FWPs)</p></li><li style=""><p>application-policy-sets</p></li><li style=""><p>global-policy objects</p></li><li style=""><p>global-policy-apply objects</p></li><li style=""><p>NPs - List of contrail networking policy objects</p></li><li style=""><p>FWPs - List of new firewall policy objects</p></li><li style=""><p>Application-policies - List of Application-policy objects </p></li><li style=""><p>Global-policies - List of new firewall policy objects,
that are defined for global access</p></li><li style=""><p>Global-policy-apply - List of global policies in a sequence,
and these policies applied during flow evaluation.</p></li><li style=""><p>Network Policies (NP) references are available, as they
are today.</p></li></ul><h3 id="jd0e339">Firewall-policy Configuration Object</h3><p><code class="inline" v-pre="">Firewall-policy </code>is a new policy object
that contains a list of firewall-rule-objects and audited flag. Firewall-policy
can be project or global scoped depending on usage. Includes an audited
Boolean flag to indicate that the owner of the policy indicated that
the policy is audited. Default is False, and will have to explicitly
be set to True after review. Generates a log event for audited with
timestamp and user details.</p><h3 id="jd0e346">Firewall-rule Configuration Object</h3><p>Firewall-rule is a new rule object, which contains the following
fields. The syntax is to give information about their layout inside
the rule.</p><ul><li style=""><p>&lt;sequence number&gt; <br/>There is a string
object sequence number on the link from firewall-policy to firewall-policy-rule
objects. The sequence number decides the order in which the rules
are applied.</p></li><li style=""><p>[&lt; id &gt;] </p><p>uuid</p></li><li style=""><p>[name &lt; name &gt;] </p><p>Unique name selected by user</p></li><li style=""><p>[description &lt; description &gt;] </p></li><li style=""><p>public</p></li><li style=""><p>{permit | deny} </p></li><li style=""><p>[ protocol {&lt; protocol-name &gt; | any } destination-port
{ &lt; port range &gt; | any } [ source-port { &lt; port range &gt; | any}
] ] | service-group &lt; name &gt; </p></li><li style=""><p>endpoint-1 { [ip &lt; prefix &gt; ] | [virtual-network &lt;
vnname &gt;] | [address-group &lt; group name &gt;] | [tags T1 == V1 &amp;&amp;
T2 == V2 … &amp;&amp; Tn == Vn &amp;&amp; label == label name...]
| any} </p></li><li style=""><p>{ -&gt; | &lt;- | &lt;-&gt; } </p><p>Specifies connection direction. All the rules are connection
oriented and this option gives the direction of the connection.</p></li><li style=""><p>endpoint-2 { [ip &lt; prefix &gt; ] | [virtual-network &lt;
vnname &gt;] | [address-group &lt; group name &gt;] | [tags T1 == V1 &amp;&amp;
T2 == V2 … &amp;&amp; Tn == Vn &amp;&amp; label == label name...]
| any } </p><p>Tags at endpoints support an expression of tags. We support
only ‘==‘ and ‘&amp;&amp;’ operators. User
can specify labels also as part the expression. Configuration object
contains list of tag names (or global:tag-name in case of global tags)
for endpoints. </p></li><li style=""><p>[ match_tags {T1 …. Tn} | none} ] </p><p>List of tag types or none. User can specify either match with
list of tags or none. Match with list of tags mean, source and destination
tag values should match for the rule to take effect.</p></li><li style=""><p>[ log| mirror | alert | activate | drop | reject | sdrop
] </p><p>complex actions</p></li><li style=""><p>{ enable | disable }</p><p>A boolean flag to indicate the rule is enabled or disabled.
Facilitates selectively turn off the rules, without remove the rule
from the policy. Default is True.</p></li><li style=""><p>filter </p></li></ul><h4 id="jd0e410">Compilation of Rules</h4><p>Whenever the API server receives a request to create/update
a firewall policy rule object, it analyzes the object data to make
sure that all virtual-networks, address-group, tag objects exist.
If any of them do not exist, the request will be rejected. In addition,
it will actually create a reference to those objects mentioned in
the two endpoints. This achieves two purposes. First, we don't allow
users to name non-existent objects in the rule and second, the user
is not allowed to delete those objects without first removing them
from all rules that are referring to them. </p><h2 id="jd0e416">Using the Contrail Web User Interface to Manage Security Policies</h2><ul><li style=""><p><a href="security-policy-enhancements.html#jd0e421">Adding Security Policies</a></p></li><li style=""><p><a href="security-policy-enhancements.html#jd0e495">Managing Policy Tags</a></p></li><li style=""><p><a href="security-policy-enhancements.html#jd0e528">Viewing Global Policies</a></p></li><li style=""><p><a href="security-policy-enhancements.html#jd0e566">Visualizing Traffic Groups</a></p></li></ul><h3 id="jd0e421">Adding Security Policies</h3><ol type="1"><li id="jd0e426" style="">To add a security policy, go to <strong v-pre="">Configure &gt; Security
