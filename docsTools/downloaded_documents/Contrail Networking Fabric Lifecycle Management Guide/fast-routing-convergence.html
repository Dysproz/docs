of routers in a network share the same topological information. The
routers in the network collect the topology information from one another
through the routing protocol. The state of convergence is achieved
when all routers send routing information to all routers in the network.
In other words, in a converged network, all routers are aware of the
network topology and the optimal route to send a packet. Any change
— for example, the failure of a device — in the network
affects convergence until information about the change is propagated
to all routers and convergence is achieved again. The time taken by
the routers in the network to reach convergence after a change in
topology is termed convergence time. </p><p>Network convergence and fast failover in case of failures in
the network are critical for high performance service provider networks
that run sensitive applications. The speed of achieving convergence
in a network depends on the following actions:</p><ul><li style=""><p>Detection—A device detects a failure in the route.
Corrective action, that is, identifying a new forwarding path, can
be taken only after identifying the device that failed. Unlike a physical
network where device availability or failure is identified through
events, in virtual network, device reachability is established through
keepalive messages. To achieve fast network convergence, the detection
time — the time taken to detect failure — is of high importance
and must be kept within acceptable limits.</p></li><li style=""><p>Local Repair—As soon as a device failure is detected
in the primary route, traffic is diverted to backup route. At this
point, the failure or the change in topology is not propagated to
all the devices in the network. </p></li><li style=""><p>Global Repair—Global repair or network convergence
is said to have achieved when the change in topology is propagated
to all devices in the network though routing protocols. </p></li></ul><p>The availability of services depends on the time taken for failure
detection and correction.</p><h2 id="id-fast-network-convergence-in-a-network-managed-by-contrail-networking">Fast Network Convergence in a Network Managed by Contrail Networking</h2><p>Contrail Networking provides software defined networking solution
that offers network virtualization at the compute node-level through
overlay networking. In a software-defined network, failures might
occur in the overlay or in the underlay. A failure in the overlay
can be the failure of a virtual machine or a pod. The vRouter can
detect, rectify, and propagate any such failure in the overlay to
the gateways by using the health check mechanism. Of the several possible
types of failure in the underlay, the most critical ones are the SDN
gateway failure and compute node failure. </p><p>Fast convergence feature improves the convergence time in case
of failures in a cluster managed by Contrail networking. In a typical
Contrail Networking-managed network, the customer end points connect
to the vRouter through MPLSoUDP, GRE, or VXLAN overlay tunnels from
the gateway device. The vRouters connect to the MPLS gateway through
the fabric endpoints. </p><p>The fabric underlay routing has evolved to the extent that most
fabric underlay failures such as those in the leaf or spine, in the
links connecting the leaf and spine or the gateway and spine, vRouter
and leaf, and so on can be efficiently addressed within a very short
time without impacting the flow of traffic. However, there are two
types of failures that can lead to silent packet drop. They are failures
in the vRouter and failures in the gateway device, both of which are
referred to as tunnel end point failures. </p><p>The overlay tunnels are maintained by the control node, which
exchanges routes between the tunnel end points. The control node uses
BGP to exchange routes with the gateway devices and XMPP to exchange
routes with the vRouter. As there are no keepalive messages running
on the overlay tunnels, the control node depends on the BGP hold time
expiration to diagnose failures in the northbound connectivity to
the gateway, and on the XMPP timeout for failures for southbound connectivity
to the vRouter. Any failure in gateway can lead to a silent packet
drop for up to 90 seconds, which is the default value for BGP hold
time and expiration. This is because the control node can detect the
gateway failure only after the BGP hold time expires. Similarly, a
failure in the vRouter can lead to a silent packet drop for up to
15 seconds, which is the default value for XMPP timeout. </p><p><a href="fast-routing-convergence.html#gateway-failure">Figure 1</a> shows what happens when
the gateway router fails. BGP hold time expires after 90 seconds as
the destination is unreachable and the same is propagated to the control
node, which recognizes that the gateway router has failed. This leads
to a silent packet drop for 90 seconds until the routing table in
the control node is updated and convergence achieved.</p><figure id="gateway-failure"><figcaption>Figure 1: Tunnel Endpoint failure: SDN Gateway</figcaption><div class="graphic"><img alt="Tunnel Endpoint failure: SDN Gateway" src="images/g301196.png" style=""/></div></figure><p><a href="fast-routing-convergence.html#vrouter-failure">Figure 2</a> shows a scenario where
the vRouter fails. The control node comes to know about the vRouter
failure only after 15 seconds when the XMPP hold time expires. Traffic
is dropped during these 15 seconds until convergence is achieved.</p><figure id="vrouter-failure"><figcaption>Figure 2: Tunnel Endpoint Failure: vRouter</figcaption></figure><div class="graphic"><img alt="" src="images/g301197.png" style=""/></div><p><span id="jd0e60">Starting with Release
2008, Contrail Networking supports fast convergence.</span> The fast convergence feature reduces the convergence time in case
of an overlay end point failure. The Contrail control plane responds
to the changes in the underlay network and then takes action to achieve
convergence quickly, reducing convergence time that would have taken
in a typical scenario where control plane depends on BGP hold time
expiration. Typically, the spines come to know of any tunnel end point
failures through the BFD or the link down protocols. With the fast
convergence feature, the spine propagates this information to the
Contrail Controller and removes the tunnel end point from the control
node through a routing table update. The control node recognizes this
as a tunnel end point failure and initiates routing convergence. To
respond to northbound failures (gateway failure), the control node
performs a next-hop reachability check, and as soon as a failure is
detected, the control plane initiates convergence. <span id="jd0e63">To achieve fast convergence in case of a southbound
failure (vRouter failure), you can set the XMPP hold time to a value
as low as one (1) second. Whenever the XMPP hold time expires, the
control node recognizes it as a failure in the vRouter and initiates
convergence.</span> Though you can set a low value
of one, the recommended timeout value is nine (9) seconds. A lower
value is recommended only for smaller clusters. </p><p><a href="fast-routing-convergence.html#fast-convergence">Figure 3</a> shows how Contrail Networking
achieves fast convergence by using the destination reachability information
that the spine gathers through BFD or link down protocols, and by
using the XMPP timeout information sent to the control node to detect
a failure in the vRouter. </p><figure id="fast-convergence"><figcaption>Figure 3: Fast Convergence in a Contrail-managed
