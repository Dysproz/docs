containers:</p><ul><li style=""><p>All of the Contrail containers are multiprocess Docker
containers. </p></li><li style=""><p>Each container has an INI-based configuration file that
has the configurations for all of the applications running in that
container. </p></li><li style=""><p>Each container is self-contained, with minimal external
orchestration needs. </p></li><li style=""><p>A single tool, <em>Ansible</em>, is used for all levels of building,
deploying, and provisioning the containers. The <em>Ansible</em> code for
the Contrail system is named <code class="inline" v-pre="">contrail-ansible</code> and kept in a separate repository. The  <em>Contrail Ansible</em> code is responsible for all aspects of Contrail container build,
deployment, and basic container orchestration.</p></li></ul><sw-prev-next> </sw-prev-next></p>
