# Understanding Contrail Microservices Architecture

 

## What is Contrail Microservices Architecture?

Employing microservices provides a number of benefits which includes:

-   Deploying patches without updating the entire Contrail deployment.

-   Better ways to manage the lifecycles of containers.

-   Improved user experiences with Contrail provisioning and upgrading.

-   Provisioning with minimum information provided.

-   Configuring every feature.

-   Simplify application complexity by implementing small, independent
    processes.

The containers and their processes are grouped as services and
microservices, and are similar to pods in the Kubernetes open-source
software used to manage containers on a server cluster.

[Figure 1](intro-microservices-contrail.html#ansov1) shows how the
Contrail containers and microservices are grouped into a pod structure
upon installation.
