includes:</p><ul><li style=""><p>Deploying patches without updating the entire Contrail
deployment.</p></li><li style=""><p>Better ways to manage the lifecycles of containers.</p></li><li style=""><p>Improved user experiences with Contrail provisioning and
upgrading.</p></li><li style=""><p>Provisioning with minimum information provided.</p></li><li style=""><p>Configuring every feature.</p></li><li style=""><p>Simplify application complexity by implementing small,
independent processes.</p></li></ul><p>The containers and their processes are grouped as services and
microservices, and are similar to pods in the Kubernetes open-source
software used to manage containers on a server cluster.</p><p><a href="intro-microservices-contrail.html#ansov1">Figure 1</a> shows how the Contrail containers
and microservices are grouped into a pod structure upon installation.</p><figure id="ansov1"><figcaption>Figure 1: Contrail Containers, Pods, and Microservices</figcaption><div class="graphic"><img alt="Contrail Containers, Pods, and Microservices" src="images/g300352.png" style=""/></div></figure><h2 id="jd0e44">Installing Contrail with Microservices Architecture</h2><p>These procedures help you to install and manage Contrail with
