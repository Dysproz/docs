Director 13.</p><p>Red Hat OpenStack Platform provides an installer called the
Red Hat OpenStack Platform director (RHOSPd or OSPd), which is a toolset
based on the OpenStack project TripleO (OOO, OpenStack on OpenStack).
TripleO is an open source project that uses features of OpenStack
to deploy a  fully functional, tenant-facing OpenStack environment. </p><p>TripleO can be used to deploy an RDO-based OpenStack environment
integrated with Tungsten Fabric. Red Hat OpenStack Platform director
can be used to deploy an RHOSP-based OpenStack environment integrated
with Contrail.</p><p>OSPd uses the concepts of undercloud and overcloud. OSPd sets
up an undercloud, a single server running an operator-facing deployment
that contains the OpenStack components needed to deploy and manage
an overcloud, a tenant-facing deployment that hosts user workloads.</p><p>The overcloud is the deployed solution that can represent a
cloud for any purpose, such as production, staging, test, and so on.
 The operator can select to deploy to their environment any of the
available overcloud roles, such as controller, compute, and the like. </p><p>OSPd leverages existing core components of OpenStack including
Nova, Ironic, Neutron, Heat, Glance, and Ceilometer to deploy OpenStack
on bare metal hardware. </p><ul><li style=""><p>Nova and Ironic are used in the undercloud to manage the
bare metal instances that comprise the infrastructure for the overcloud. </p></li><li style=""><p>Neutron is used to provide a networking environment in
which to deploy the overcloud.</p></li><li style=""><p>Glance stores machine images.</p></li><li style=""><p>Ceilometer collects metrics about the overcloud.</p></li></ul><p>For more information about OSPd architecture, see <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/developer/tripleo-docs/introduction/architecture.html">OSPd documentation</a>.</p><h2 id="id-composable-roles">Contrail Roles</h2><p>OSPd supports composable roles, which are groups of services
that you define through Heat templates. Composable roles allow you
to integrate Contrail into the overcloud environment.</p><p>The following are the Contrail roles used for integrating into
the overcloud: </p><ul><li style=""><p>Contrail Controller</p></li><li style=""><p>Contrail Analytics</p></li><li style=""><p>Contrail Analytics Database</p></li><li style=""><p>Contrail-TSN</p></li><li style=""><p>Contrail-DPDK</p></li></ul><p><a href="setting-up-contrail-rhosp-introduction.html#rhosp1">Figure 1</a> shows the relationship and components
of an undercloud and overcloud architecture for Contrail.</p><figure id="rhosp1"><figcaption>Figure 1: Undercloud and Overcloud with Roles</figcaption><div class="graphic"><img alt="Undercloud and Overcloud with Roles" src="documentation/images/g300376.png" style=""/></div></figure><h2 id="id-undercloud-requirements">Undercloud Requirements</h2><p>The undercloud is a single server or VM that hosts the OpenStack
Platform director, which is an OpenStack installation used to provision
OpenStack on the overcloud.</p><p>See <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html/director_installation_and_usage/chap-requirements#sect-Undercloud_Requirements">Undercloud Requirements</a> for the compute requirements of the
undercloud.</p><h2 id="id-preparing-for-the-contrail-roles">Overcloud Requirements</h2><p>The overcloud roles can be deployed to bare metal servers or
to virtual machines (VMs), but the compute nodes must be deployed
to bare metal systems. Every overcloud node must support IPMI for
booting up from the undercloud using PXE. </p><p>Ensure the following requirements are met for the Contrail nodes
per role.</p><ul><li style=""><p>Non-high availability: A minimum of 4 overcloud nodes
are needed for control plane roles for a non-high availability deployment:</p><ul><li style=""><p>1x contrail-config (includes Contrail control)</p></li><li style=""><p>1x contrail-analytics</p></li><li style=""><p>1x contrail-analytics-database</p></li><li style=""><p>1x OpenStack controller</p></li></ul></li><li style=""><p>High availability: A minimum of 12 overcloud nodes are
needed for control plane roles for a high availability deployment:</p><ul><li style=""><p>3x contrail-config (includes Contrail control)</p></li><li style=""><p>3x contrail-analytics</p></li><li style=""><p>3x contrail-analytics-database</p></li><li style=""><p>3x OpenStack controller</p></li></ul><p>If the control plane roles are deployed to VMs, use 3 separate
physical servers and deploy one role of each kind to each physical
server.</p></li></ul><p>See <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html/director_installation_and_usage/chap-requirements#sect-Overcloud_Requirements">Overcloud Requirements</a> for the compute requirements of the
overcloud.</p><h2 id="id-network-isolation">Networking Requirements</h2><p>As a minimum, the installation requires two networks:</p><ul><li style=""><p>provisioning network - This is the private network that
the undercloud uses to provision the overcloud. </p></li><li style=""><p>external network - This is the externally-routable network
you use to access the undercloud and overcloud nodes.</p></li></ul><p>Ensure the following requirements are met for the provisioning
network:</p><ul><li style=""><p>One NIC from every machine must be in the same broadcast
domain of the provisioning network, and it should be the same NIC
on each of the overcloud machines. For example, if you use the second
NIC on the first overcloud machine, you should use the second NIC
on each additional overcloud machine.    </p><p>During installation, these NICs will be referenced by a single
name across all overcloud machines.</p></li><li style=""><p>The provisioning network NIC should not be the same NIC
that you are using for remote connectivity to the undercloud machine.
During the undercloud installation, an Open vSwitch bridge will be
created for Neutron, and the provisioning NIC will be bridged to the
Open vSwitch bridge. Consequently, connectivity would be lost if the
provisioning NIC was also used for remote connectivity to the undercloud
machine.</p></li><li style=""><p>The provisioning NIC on the overcloud nodes must be untagged.</p></li><li style=""><p>You must have the MAC address of the NIC that will PXE
boot the IPMI information for the machine on the provisioning network.
The IPMI information will include such things as the  IP address of
the IPMI NIC and the IPMI username and password. </p></li><li style=""><p>All of the networks must be available to all of the Contrail
roles and computes.</p></li></ul><p>While the provisioning and external networks are sufficient
for basic applications, you should create additional networks in most
overcloud environments to provide isolation for the different traffic
types by assigning network traffic to specific network interfaces
or bonds.</p><p>When isolated networks are configured, the OpenStack services
are configured to use the isolated networks. If no isolated networks
are configured, all services run on the provisioning network. If only
some isolated networks are configured, traffic belonging to a network
not configured runs on the provisioning network.</p><p>The following networks are typically deployed when using
network isolation topology:</p><ul><li style=""><p>Provisioning - used by the undercloud to provision the
overcloud</p></li><li style=""><p>Internal API - used by OpenStack services to communicate
with each other</p></li><li style=""><p>Tenant - used for tenant overlay data plane traffic (one
network per tenant)</p></li><li style=""><p>Storage - used for storage data traffic</p></li><li style=""><p>Storage Management - used for storage control and management
traffic</p></li><li style=""><p>External - provides external access to the undercloud
and overcloud, including external access to the web UIs and public
APIs</p></li><li style=""><p>Floating IP - provides floating IP access to the tenant
network (can either be merged with external or can be a separate network)</p></li><li style=""><p>Management - provides access for system administration</p></li></ul><p>For more information on the different network types, see <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html-single/director_installation_and_usage/#sect-Planning_Networks">Planning Networks</a>.</p><p>For more information on networking requirements, see <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html-single/director_installation_and_usage/#sect-Networking_Requirements">Networking Requirements</a>.</p><h2 id="id-supported-combinations">Compatibility Matrix</h2><p>The following combinations of Operating System/OpenStack/Deployer/Contrail
